<p>Flow control, in general, refers to a network transmission in which the sender actively limits the rate at which it sends data or the amount of data it sends to match the speed at which the receiver processes the data. When the receiver's processing speed is slow, the data that is too slow to be processed is stored in memory, and when the data buffer in memory is filled, the newly received data is thrown away, causing the sender to retransmit, resulting in a waste of network bandwidth.</p>
<p>flow control is a basic function of a network component, and the TCP protocol, as we know it, specifies the flow control algorithm. gRPC is built on top of TCP and also relies on the HTTP/2 <code>WindowUpdate</code> frame to implement its own flow control at the application layer.</p>
<p>In gRPC, flow control is embodied in three dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sampling flow control: The gRCP receiver detects the amount of data received over a period of time, inferring the amount of on-wire data, and directs the sender to adjust the flow control window.</li>
<li>Connection level flow control: The sender is assigned a quota (quota) at initialization, which decreases as data is sent and increases after receiving feedback from the receiver. The sender cannot send any more data after the quota is exhausted.</li>
<li>Stream level flow control: Similar to connection level flow control, except that connection level manages all traffic between a sender and a receiver, while stream level manages one of the many streams in a connection.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rest of this article, we will take a look at the principles and implementation details of these three types of flow control in conjunction with the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flow control is bi-directional, and to reduce redundancy, in this article we only describe how gRPC controls the traffic sent by the server.<br>
Flow control in gRPC is only for HTTP/2 data frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="sampling-flow-control">Sampling flow control</h1>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>Sampled Flow Control, or <strong>BDP Estimation and Dynamic Flow Control Window</strong> to be exact, is a flow control method that collects data on the receiving end to determine the size of the flow control window on the sending end. Refer to <a href="https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-go-perf-improvements/">gRPC-Go performance Improvements</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature is the latest and in some ways the most awaited optimization feature that has helped us close the final gap between gRPC and HTTP/1.1 performance on high latency networks.<br>
Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP) is the bandwidth of a network connection times its round-trip latency. This effectively tells us how many bytes can be “on the wire” at a given moment, if full utilization is achieved.<br>
The algorithm to compute BDP and adapt accordingly was first proposed by @ejona and later implemented by both gRPC-C core and gRPC-Java (note that it isn’t enabled in Java yet). The idea is simple and powerful: every time a receiver gets a data frame it sends out a BDP ping (a ping with unique data only used by BDP estimator). After this, the receiver starts counting the number of bytes it receives (including the ones that triggered the BDP ping) until it receives the ack for that ping. This total sum of all bytes received in about 1.5 RTT (Round-Trip Time) is an approximation of the effective BDP * 1.5. If this is close to our current window size (say, more than 2/3rd of it) we must increase the window size. We put our window sizes (both streaming and connection) to be twice the BDP we sampled(total sum of all bytes received).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BDP sampling is currently enabled by default on the server side of gRPC-go.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the code and see how it is implemented.</p>
<h2 id="codes">Codes</h2>
<p>Let's take the example of a client sending a BDP ping to a server, and determining the flow control window on the server side.</p>
<p>There is a <code>bdpEstimator</code> defined in gRPC-go , which is the core of the BDP calculation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type bdpEstimator struct {
	// sentAt is the time when the ping was sent.
	sentAt time.Time

	mu sync.Mutex
	// bdp is the current bdp estimate.
	bdp uint32
	// sample is the number of bytes received in one measurement cycle.
	sample uint32
	// bwMax is the maximum bandwidth noted so far (bytes/sec).
	bwMax float64
	// bool to keep track of the beginning of a new measurement cycle.
	isSent bool
	// Callback to update the window sizes.
	updateFlowControl func(n uint32)
	// sampleCount is the number of samples taken so far.
	sampleCount uint64
	// round trip time (seconds)
	rtt float64
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>bdpEstimator</code> has two main methods <code>add</code> and <code>calculate</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// the return value of `add` is used to determine whether to send a BDP ping frame to the server.
func (b *bdpEstimator) add(n uint32) bool {
	b.mu.Lock()
	defer b.mu.Unlock()
    // if bdp is already at the max, don't send a BDP ping to the server.
	if b.bdp == bdpLimit {
		return false
	}
    // if we haven't sent a BDP ping yet, we should send one.
	if !b.isSent {
		b.isSent = true
		b.sample = n
		b.sentAt = time.Time{}
		b.sampleCount++
		return true
	}
    // if we have sent a BDP ping, but haven't received an ACK yet, we should send one.
	b.sample += n
	return false
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>add</code> function has two functionatilies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determines whether the client starts sampling when it receives data.</li>
<li>It records the time when sampling starts and the initial amount of data.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (t *http2Client) handleData(f *http2.DataFrame) {
size := f.Header().Length
	var sendBDPPing bool
	if t.bdpEst != nil {
		sendBDPPing = t.bdpEst.add(size)
	}
	......
	if sendBDPPing {
		......
		t.controlBuf.put(bdpPing)
	}
	......
}

var bdpPing = &amp;ping{data: [8]byte{2, 4, 16, 16, 9, 14, 7, 7}}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>handleData</code> function is a function that the gRPC client executes after it receives an HTTP/2 data frame from a server, from which we can see:</p>
<p>gRPC client and each server maintain a <code>bdpEstimator</code> .<br>
Each time a data frame is received, the gRPC client determines whether it needs to sample it. At the same time, the same client will only sample once.<br>
If sampling is required, a bdpPing frame is sent to the client.</p>
<p>After the Server side receives a bdpPing frame, it will immediately return a ping frame and flag the ACK, and the server will capture the ACK:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (t *http2Client) handlePing(f *http2.PingFrame) {
	if f.IsAck() {
		......
		if t.bdpEst != nil {
			t.bdpEst.calculate(f.Data)
		}
		return
	}
	......
}
</code></pre>
<p>Server calls <code>handlePing</code> when it receives a HTTP/2 ping frame, and when that ping frame contains the ACK flag, <code>calculate</code> will be triggered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (b *bdpEstimator) calculate(d [8]byte) {
	// Check if the ping acked for was the bdp ping.
	if bdpPing.data != d {
		return
	}
	b.mu.Lock()
	rttSample := time.Since(b.sentAt).Seconds()
	if b.sampleCount &lt; 10 {
		// Bootstrap rtt with an average of first 10 rtt samples.
		b.rtt += (rttSample - b.rtt) / float64(b.sampleCount)
	} else {
		// Heed to the recent past more.
		b.rtt += (rttSample - b.rtt) * float64(alpha)
	}
	b.isSent = false
	// The number of bytes accumulated so far in the sample is smaller
	// than or equal to 1.5 times the real BDP on a saturated connection.
	bwCurrent := float64(b.sample) / (b.rtt * float64(1.5))
	if bwCurrent &gt; b.bwMax {
		b.bwMax = bwCurrent
	}
	// If the current sample (which is smaller than or equal to the 1.5 times the real BDP) is
	// greater than or equal to 2/3rd our perceived bdp AND this is the maximum bandwidth seen so far, we
	// should update our perception of the network BDP.
	if float64(b.sample) &gt;= beta*float64(b.bdp) &amp;&amp; bwCurrent == b.bwMax &amp;&amp; b.bdp != bdpLimit {
		sampleFloat := float64(b.sample)
		b.bdp = uint32(gamma * sampleFloat)
		if b.bdp &gt; bdpLimit {
			b.bdp = bdpLimit
		}
		bdp := b.bdp
		b.mu.Unlock()
		b.updateFlowControl(bdp)
		return
	}
	b.mu.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>calculate</code>, the current bdp value is obtained after a series of calculations, and if the flow control needs to be updated, the <code>updateFlowControl</code> function registered in the <code>bdpEstimator</code> is called and the new window size is passed in.</p>
<p>So how is the new window size handled in <code>updateFlowControl</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// updateFlowControl updates the incoming flow control windows
// for the transport and the stream based on the current bdp
// estimation.
func (t *http2Server) updateFlowControl(n uint32) {
	t.mu.Lock()
	for _, s := range t.activeStreams {
		s.fc.newLimit(n)
	}
	t.initialWindowSize = int32(n)
	t.mu.Unlock()
	t.controlBuf.put(&amp;outgoingWindowUpdate{
		streamID:  0,
		increment: t.fc.newLimit(n),
	})
	t.controlBuf.put(&amp;outgoingSettings{
		ss: []http2.Setting{
			{
				ID:  http2.SettingInitialWindowSize,
				Val: n,
			},
		},
	})

}
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that BDP sampling results affect the window size of HTTP/2, the window size of connection level, and the window size of stream level. The effect of BDP on gRPC is dynamic and comprehensive.</p>
<h1 id="connection-flow-control">Connection Flow Control</h1>
<h2 id="concepts-2">Concepts</h2>
<p>In gRPC, a TCP connection is maintained between each client and server pair, and connection level flow control is targeted at this unique connection. At the beginning of the connection, the server is assigned a traffic quota, which defaults to 65535 bytes. flow control revolves around this quota:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the server sends <code>n</code> bytes of data to the client, <code>quota -= n</code></li>
<li>When the server receives an HTTP/2 WindowUpdate Frame (henceforth window update) from the client, <code>quota += m</code>, based on the value <code>m</code> specified in the window update</li>
<li>When the server's quota is 0, the server will not be able to send any data to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to control the traffic on the server side, the client side is assigned a limit at connection initialization, which is 65535 bytes by default. When the <code>unacked</code> exceeds a quarter of the limit, the client sends a window update (with the value of <code>unacked</code>) to the server to inform it that it can add back the quota and reset the <code>unacked</code> to zero.</p>
<p>You can see that in order to avoid sending windows update frequently and consuming network bandwidth, the client does not send window update every time it receives data, but waits until the amount of data received reaches a certain threshold. Note that the limit * 1/4 threshold is not modifiable.</p>
<h2 id="codes-2">Codes</h2>
<h3 id="server-side">Server Side</h3>
<pre><code class="language-go">type loopyWriter struct {
	......
    // quota that server has left to send on a single connection
	sendQuota uint32
	......
}
</code></pre>
<p>On the server side, the quota is expressed as <code>sendQuota</code> .</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (l *loopyWriter) processData() (bool, error) {
    // if sendQuota is 0, do not send any data
	if l.sendQuota == 0 {
		return true, nil
	}
	......
}
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>sendQuota</code> is 0, the server does not send data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// incomingWindowUpdateHandler is called when the server receives a window update frame from the client.
func (l *loopyWriter) incomingWindowUpdateHandler(w *incomingWindowUpdate) error {
	if w.streamID == 0 {
		// add quota
		l.sendQuota += w.increment
		return nil
	}
	......
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>sendQuota</code> is increased after receiving a window update from the client.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (l *loopyWriter) processData() (bool, error) {
	......
    // reduce sendQuota by the amount of data sent
	l.sendQuota -= uint32(size)
	......
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the server will reduce <code>sendQuota</code> when sending data .</p>
<h3 id="client-side">Client Side</h3>
<pre><code class="language-go">// trInFlow is the core of the client side flow control.
type trInFlow struct {
    // server quota
	limit               uint32
    // data received by the client but ack not yet sent to the server
	unacked             uint32
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>trInFlow</code> is the core of client-side control over whether to send window updates. It is important to note that whether the client side sends a window update depends only on the amount of data already received, regardless of whether that data is read by some stream. This is an optimization of gRPC in flow control, i.e. because multiple streams share the same connection, it should not affect the flow control at the connection level because one stream is slow to read data, affecting other streams.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">// n represents the number of bytes received by the client, and the return value is the number of bytes that need to be sent to the server.
// If the return value is 0, the client does not need to send a window update.
func (f *trInFlow) onData(n uint32) uint32 {
	f.unacked += n
    // if the client has received more than 1/4 of the server's quota, it should send a window update.
	if f.unacked &gt;= f.limit/4 {
		w := f.unacked
		f.unacked = 0
		f.updateEffectiveWindowSize()
		return w
	}
	f.updateEffectiveWindowSize()
	return 0
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>limit * 1/4</code> limit can actually be floated, because the limit value will change with the window update sent from the server.</p>
<h1 id="stream-flow-control">Stream Flow Control</h1>
<h2 id="concepts-3">Concepts</h2>
<p>Stream level flow control and connection level flow control are basically the same, with two main differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>The quota in stream level flow control is only for a single stream. Each stream is subject to both stream level flow control and connection level flow control.</li>
<li>The timing of the feedback to the server window update frame is a bit more complicated on the client side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stream level flow control not only keeps track of the amount of data received, but also the amount of data consumed by the stream to achieve more accurate flow control. In fact, the client will record:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>pendingData</strong>: the amount of data received by the stream that has not yet been consumed (not read) by the application.</li>
<li><strong>pendingUpdate</strong>: The amount of data received by the stream that has already been consumed (read) by the application.</li>
<li><strong>limit</strong>: The maximum amount of data the stream can accept, which is initially set to 65535 bytes, subject to sample flow control.</li>
<li><strong>delta</strong>: delta is the amount of data added to the limit, when the application tries to read more data than the limit, delta is temporarily added to the limit to allow the application to read the data.</li>
</ol>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://xinzheng0459.github.io/post-images/gRPC_Deep_Dive/stream_level_flow_control.png" alt="stream level flow control" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The logic on the Client side looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whenever the client receives a data frame from the server, <code>pendingData</code> += <code>the amount of data received</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the application reads data from the stream (i.e., when the pendingData will be consumed), the client knows that it should be able to read <code>n</code> bytes of data because the size of the data frame is sent to the client in advance in the headers frame. The client side will try to estimate the quota on the server side at this point, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the client knows that the total amount of data received by the server is <code>pendingData + pendingUpdate</code>, the maximum value of the quota remaining on the server can be estimated as <code>limit - (pendingData + pendingUpdate)</code>. The reason why we can only estimate the maximum value is that the client cannot know exactly how much data the server has sent but the client has not yet received.</li>
<li>Since the client knows that it should be able to read <code>n</code> bytes of data, the maximum value of data not yet sent by the server can be inferred to be <code>n - pendingData</code>, and similarly, since it does not know how much data is being transmitted over the network, the maximum value can only be inferred.</li>
<li>Then if the server is still sending the maximum amount of data, which is larger than the maximum amount of the server's remaining quota, it means that the client has to send a window update to the server to temporarily increase the server's quota limit in order for the server to send the data. How much should be raised? The gRPC client chooses to raise the server's quota by <code>n</code> bytes. And record this <code>n</code> value in <code>delta</code>.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>This logic ensures that the server does not stall when sending a large amount of data in one data frame transfer because the quota limit is too low.</p>
<p>Note that the application is not actually reading data from the stream until now. All of the above adjustments happen before the read, which is equivalent to warming up the data before it is read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the application actually reads <code>n</code> bytes of data from the stream, the client needs to measure again whether it needs to send a window update to the server to update the server's quota:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pendingData -= n</code></li>
<li>Compare the size of the data to be read, <code>n</code>, with <code>delta</code>, and try to offset <code>delta</code>. This is done because the <code>delta</code> value is an additional temporary quota increase, and since so much data has already been added to the quota on the server side, the client does not need to send a window update to the server for this data. All this is to gradually eliminate the quota that was added temporarily to allow the server to send large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-go">if n &gt; delta {
	n -= delta
	delta = 0
} else {
	delta -= n
	n = 0
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>After offsetting with delta, <code>n</code> is added to <code>pendingUpdate</code>, which means that <code>n</code> bytes of data will be read on the stream and no feedback will be sent to the server. When the size of this data exceeds the <code>limit * 1/4</code>, a window update is sent to the server, and the quota is increased by the amount of <code>pendingUpdate</code>.</li>
<li>Clear <code>pendingUpdate</code> to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see from the above analysis, the stream level also needs to sum the speed of the application reading data from the stream in order to better control the traffic on the stream. And gRPC also adds an extra value of <code>delta</code> for this purpose to avoid stream blocking due to traffic control.</p>
